# Changes

All significant changes to this project may be documented in the notes below.
This project does not adhere to any specific versioning scheme. Specifically,
please see [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for the fascinating details
of how the versioning scheme that this project does not use is clearly superior
to random natural numbers and how incrementing the minor version number
indicates backward compatible changes, unless it does not.
